3. Designing the Digital Identity Model

Before coding, define what an identity is.

A simple digital identity can include:

Owner (principal)

Username or handle

Metadata URI (IPFS / HTTPS)

Timestamp of creation

Active / revoked status

On-chain vs off-chain data

On-chain: ownership, pointers, verification

Off-chain: photos, documents, large JSON files
