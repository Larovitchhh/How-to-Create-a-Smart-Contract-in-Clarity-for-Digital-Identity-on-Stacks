9. Security and Best Practices

For production-ready identity contracts:

Avoid admin-only controls

Never store sensitive personal data on-chain

Use IPFS or trusted HTTPS endpoints

Add versioning for future upgrades

Document error codes clearly

Clarity’s design already removes many common attack vectors, but identity contracts must be especially conservative.
