Clarity is different from Solidity or Rust-based smart contract languages:

Feature	Clarity
Execution model	Interpreted (not compiled)
Security	No re-entrancy, no hidden state
Transparency	Full contract logic visible
Suitability for identity	⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

For identity systems, predictability and transparency are critical—making Clarity an excellent choice.
