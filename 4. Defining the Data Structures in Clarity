4. Defining the Data Structures in Clarity

We use a map to store identities indexed by user principal.

(define-map identities
  principal
  {
    username: (string-ascii 32),
    uri: (string-utf8 256),
    created-at: uint,
    active: bool
  }
)


Why this structure?

principal ensures one identity per wallet

uri points to verifiable off-chain data

active allows revocation without deletion
