Traditional digital identities are:

Centralized

Prone to data breaches

Hard to verify across platforms

A blockchain-based identity on Stacks offers:

Self-sovereign ownership (user controls their identity)

Immutability (secured by Bitcoin finality)

Interoperability with wallets and dApps

Auditability without revealing private data

Stacks is especially well suited because Clarity is decidable and interpretable, meaning you always know exactly what a contract will do before execution.
